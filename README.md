# Project Assignment

In this assignment, I have implemented the basic functionality that was given in the requirements.
I have written the code myself and tried to keep the project simple and clean.

This project includes:
- Implemented the required features
- Organized the code in separate files
- Added basic validation and error handling
- Made the project ready to submit through GitHub

If any changes or improvements are needed, I can update it.
This is the final version I have completed.
